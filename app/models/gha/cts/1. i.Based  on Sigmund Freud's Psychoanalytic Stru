1. i.Based  on Sigmund Freud's Psychoanalytic Structural theory which divides psyche into id, the ego and the super-ego. 
	The manager who drinks and smokes excessively on the job operates based on his id which is unorganized and unconscious and operately most on the
	pleasure principle (the psychic force that motivates the tendency to seek immediate gratification of any impulse.) without taking into foresight the impact of such action on the reality of his work.

4. The following reasons are behind organization's interest in knowledge management. 
	Possibility of quick explicit knowledge sharing and ease of connecting people for sharing of tacit knowledge that has been made reality by rapid advance in 
	Information Technology System.
	Because of organizational resource shift from natural to intellectual capital, top executives have found it imperative to appraise their organization's knowledge

	The first approach for knowledge management is about collection and sharing of explicit knowledge, largely through the use of sophisticated information technology. Explicit knowledge may include intellectual properties such as patients and licenses etc. When an organization uses this approach, the focus is collection and codifying knowlegde and storing it in database where it can easily be accessed and reuse  by anyone in the organization. The knowledge from individual are taken in put into documents that can be accessed by anyone within the organization. This approach is mainly used by some consulting firms.

	The last approach focuses on leveraging individual expertise and tacit knowledge, by connecting people face-to-face or through interactive media. In this approach managers concentrate on developing personal networks that links people together for the sharing of tacit knowledge. Information technology is employ primarily to support and faciliates conversations and person-to-person sharing of tacit-knowledge.

	The following are the benefits of knowledge management to an organization:

	a. Enablment of corporate renewal.
	b. Enable learning and transformation.
	c. Improve/increase organization's efficiency and productivity.
	d. Increase revenue.
	e. Translation of knowledge into innovative actions.
